This includes geological mapping, digital compilation of historical data, auger geochemistry drilling, underground sampling, topographic surveys, and successful drilling campaigns totaling 2,582 meters. The historical development of the Sewum deposit has involved intermittent activity, with over 170,000 tons of ore mined at an average grade of 15g/t. Noteworthy historical drilling results include intersections of 1.4 meters at 14.87g/t and 2 meters at 18.8g/t. In addition, the property was soil sampled by Leo Shield Exploration in the late 1980s and by Redback/Edgewater Exploration in the mid-2000s. Trenching and pitting programs from these earlier campaigns confirmed gold-in-soil anomalies.",
